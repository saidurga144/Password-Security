# 🔐 Cyber Security Internship – Task 6

## 🎯 Task Title:
**Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength**

---

## 🧾 Task Objective:
Understand what makes a password strong, test different types of passwords using an online strength checker, and summarize security best practices.

## 🛠️ Tools Used:
- [passwordmeter.com](https://www.passwordmeter.com/)
- GitHub for report submission

## 🔢 Passwords Tested:

| Password            | Complexity     | Strength (%) | Notes                                 |
|---------------------|----------------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| elevate1            | Weak           | 24%          | Common and predictable                 |
| elevatelabs123      | Good           | 50%          | Mixed characters but still guessable   |
| Elevate@1           | Strong         | 69%          | Good length and variety                |
| Mickymouse$2025@@   | Very Strong    | 100%         | High complexity, randomness, and length|

---

## 📚 Tips Learned from Evaluation:
- Longer passwords = stronger protection.
- Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid predictable patterns and dictionary words.
- Random characters greatly improve strength.
- Never reuse passwords across platforms.
- Use password managers to generate and store secure passwords.

---

## 🛡️ Common Password Attacks:
- **Brute Force**: Tries every possible combination. Slowed down by long, complex passwords.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses common words. Avoided by not using real words or common phrases.

---

## 🔐 Password Complexity & Security:
- **Length** increases time required to crack.
- **Character variety** increases combinations.
- **Randomness** makes guessing harder.
- **Unique passwords** protect against reused credentials.
